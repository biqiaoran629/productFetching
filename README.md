# Considerations
### Given more time, what can be improved?
* it should handle more product types by having more matching patterns - I noticed at least one more pattern can be mapped. 
* implement adapters towards all open source softwares. So when they change their API, I only have to change what's in the adapter, and not have to scan the whole repo.

# Question and Answers
* What were the biggest challenges you faced in writing the challenge?
  * Time management. A week/ 4 hours is pretty short, considering I am not familiar with this particular project. Although I know what the general idea is, but it takes time to fill in the details. Research, design, setup, code, test, integration test, deploy can all take time, so I have to pick the most important ones to complete first. Because each topic can go really deep, so I have to try not to focus something too hard and get the general app running first.
  * Limited constraints. I usually work with tight constraints and limited scope, so putting everything up from the ground up is definitely a big challenge to me. However, I think I am able to pick the most important info from the email, and treat this as a ticket from my PO, and stand on his/her POV and figure out what are the most important things for this project. I didn't spend too much time on research, where I can code up all patterns. I didn't spend too much time on writing the perfect error handling mechnism, although given more time I could. The most important thing is to have a app running, and that should be my focus.
* Can you explain your thought process on how you solved the problem, and what iterations you went through to get to this solution?
* If you had to scale this application to handle millions of people adding in ASIN's in a given day, what considerations would you make?
* Why did you choose the technologies you used?
